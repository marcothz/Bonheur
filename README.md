# Bonheur

Currently this project is a rough draft, an idea I'm trying to get off the drawing board.

## Motivation

Most of the time, I work with applications that are HTTP-based APIs. I am aware that there are good alternatives to unit testing, but I have difficulty finding a suitable alternative to integration testing.

My goal with this project is to make my own life easier in running Integration Tests. Hopefully (and humbly) this project can make life easier for others.
